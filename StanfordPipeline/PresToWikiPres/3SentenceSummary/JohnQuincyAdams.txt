Early life, education, and early career[edit]
John Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, to John Adams and his wife Abigail Adams (n�e Smith) in a part of Braintree, Massachusetts that is now Quincy. In his biography, Samuel Flagg Bemis argues that Adams was able to:

"gather together, formulate, and practice the fundamentals of American foreign-policy � self-determination, independence, noncolonization, nonintervention, nonentanglement in European politics, Freedom of the Seas, [and] freedom of commerce." [4]
Adams was the son of former President John Adams and Abigail Adams.

Early life[edit]
Buchanan was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761�1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767�1833). He is, to date, the only president from Pennsylvania and the only president to remain a lifelong bachelor.

McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish�American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals. McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. After the war, he settled in Canton, Ohio, where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton. He was elected Ohio�s governor in 1891 and 1893, steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests. He defeated his Democratic rival, William Jennings Bryan, after a front-porch campaign in which he advocated �sound money� (the gold standard unless altered by international agreement) and 
promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity.

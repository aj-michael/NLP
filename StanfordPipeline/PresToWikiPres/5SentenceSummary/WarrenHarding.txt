Harding, c. 1882
Warren Gamaliel Harding was born November 2, 1865, in Blooming Grove, Ohio. Harding sought out the "best minds" in his cabinet, including Andrew Mellon at the Treasury, Herbert Hoover at Commerce, and Charles Evans Hughes at the State Department. He promised America a "return to normalcy", with an end to violence and radicalism, a strong economy, and independence from European intrigues. He defeated Democrat and fellow Ohio newspaper publisher James M. Cox with the largest popular vote landslide (60% to 34%) in presidential history.

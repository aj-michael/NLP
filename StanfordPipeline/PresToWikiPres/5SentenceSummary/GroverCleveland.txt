Caldwell Presbyterian parsonage, birthplace of Grover Cleveland
Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey to Richard Falley Cleveland and Ann Neal Cleveland. [1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to Free Silver also alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.

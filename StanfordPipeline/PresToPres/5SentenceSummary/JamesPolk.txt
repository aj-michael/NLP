He was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in 1795. Studious and industrious, Polk was graduated with honors in 1818 from the University of North Carolina. In the House of Representatives, Polk was a chief lieutenant of Jackson in his Bank war. As a young lawyer he entered politics, served in the Tennessee legislature, and became a friend of Andrew Jackson. Both Martin Van Buren, who had been expected to win the Democratic nomination for President, and Henry Clay, who was to be the Whig nominee, tried to take the expansionist issue out of the campaign by declaring themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas.

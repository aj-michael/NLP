Kennedy was the youngest man elected President; he was the youngest to die. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history. Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate.

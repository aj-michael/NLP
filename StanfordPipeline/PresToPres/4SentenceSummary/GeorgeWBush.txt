The attacks put on hold many of Bush�s hopes and plans, and Bush�s father, George Bush, the 41st president, declared that his son �faced the greatest challenge of any president since Abraham Lincoln. In response, Bush formed a new cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security, sent American forces into Afghanistan to break up the Taliban, a movement under Osama bin Laden that trained financed and exported terrorist teams. Following the attacks, the president also recast the nation�s intelligence gathering and analysis services, and ordered reform of the military forces to meet the new enemy. The Taliban was successfully disrupted but Bin Laden was not captured and was still on the loose as Bush began his second term.

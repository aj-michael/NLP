Born in the Finger Lakes country of New York in 1800, Fillmore as a youth endured the privations of frontier life. As an associate of the Whig politician Thurlow Weed, Fillmore held state office and for eight years was a member of the House of Representatives. He attended one-room schools, and fell in love with the redheaded teacher, Abigail Powers, who later became his wife. He worked on his father's farm, and at 15 was apprenticed to a cloth dresser.

On February 6, 1911, Ronald Wilson Reagan was born to Nelle and John Reagan in Tampico, Illinois. He felt he had fulfilled his campaign pledge of 1980 to restore "the great, confident roar of American progress and growth and optimism." There, he studied economics and sociology, played on the football team, and acted in school plays. He attended high school in nearby Dixon and then worked his way through Eureka College.

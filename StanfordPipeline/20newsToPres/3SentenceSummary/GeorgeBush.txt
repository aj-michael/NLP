Coming from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. In his Inaugural Address he pledged in "a moment rich with promise" to use American strength as "a force for good." Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover.

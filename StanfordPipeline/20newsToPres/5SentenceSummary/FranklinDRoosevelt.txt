Following the example of his fifth cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, whom he greatly admired, Franklin D. Roosevelt entered public service through politics, but as a Democrat. Born in 1882 at Hyde Park, New York--now a national historic site--he attended Harvard University and Columbia Law School. He brought hope as he promised prompt, vigorous action, and asserted in his Inaugural Address, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself." On St. Patrick's Day, 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt. President Wilson appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and he was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in 1920.

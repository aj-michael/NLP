Studious and industrious, Polk was graduated with honors in 1818 from the University of North Carolina. He was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in 1795. In the House of Representatives, Polk was a chief lieutenant of Jackson in his Bank war. As a young lawyer he entered politics, served in the Tennessee legislature, and became a friend of Andrew Jackson. Until circumstances raised Polk's ambitions, he was a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for Vice President in 1844.

One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in New Jersey in 1837. Cleveland won the Presidency with the combined support of Democrats and reform Republicans, the "Mugwumps," who disliked the record of his opponent James G. Blaine of Maine. Vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas, he wrote: "Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . . "

He also vetoed many private pension bills to Civil War veterans whose claims were fraudulent. A bachelor, Cleveland was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White House. As a lawyer in Buffalo, he became notable for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced him.

"No one but the President," he said, "seems to be expected ... to look out for the general interests of the country." He was born in Virginia in 1856, the son of a Presbyterian minister who during the Civil War was a pastor in Augusta, Georgia, and during Reconstruction a professor in the charred city of Columbia, South Carolina. After graduation from Princeton (then the College of New Jersey) and the University of Virginia Law School, Wilson earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University and entered upon an academic career. In 1917 he proclaimed American entrance into World War I a crusade to make the world "safe for democracy."

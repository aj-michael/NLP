Kennedy was the youngest man elected President; he was the youngest to die. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President.

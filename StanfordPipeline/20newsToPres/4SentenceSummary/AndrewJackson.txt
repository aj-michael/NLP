Born in a backwoods settlement in the Carolinas in 1767, he received sporadic education. Fiercely jealous of his honor, he engaged in brawls, and in a duel killed a man who cast an unjustified slur on his wife Rachel. But in his late teens he read law for about two years, and he became an outstanding young lawyer in Tennessee. In 1824 some state political factions rallied around Jackson; by 1828 enough had joined "Old Hickory" to win numerous state elections and control of the Federal administration in Washington.
